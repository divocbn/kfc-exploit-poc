# KFC.de Security Vulnerability PoC

This project demonstrates a proof of concept (PoC) for a security vulnerability discovered on the KFC.de website, allowing users to place orders for free.

The vulnerability exploits the payment method selection during the order process. <br />
There are 3 payment methods available:
 - applepay
 - cash
 - card

By selecting a payment method thats not in the list, for example: `free`, the order is processed **WITHOUT** requiring payment.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
