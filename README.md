# KFC.de Security Vulnerability PoC

This project demonstrates a proof of concept (PoC) for a security vulnerability discovered on the KFC.de website, allowing users to place orders for free.

The vulnerability exploits the payment method selection during the order process. 
By selecting a non-standard payment method (other than "applepay", "cash", or "card"), the order is processed without requiring payment.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
